This week, I explored the process of creating a React application 
using Vite, which gave me a deeper understanding of how fast and 
efficient React development can be. I also learned about props and 
how they function similarly to parameters in JavaScript functions, 
allowing data to be passed between components in a flexible way. 
In addition, I was introduced to the useState hook, which helped 
me understand how React manages and updates component state 
dynamically. Altogether, these concepts gave me a solid foundation 
for building interactive and reusable UI components.
